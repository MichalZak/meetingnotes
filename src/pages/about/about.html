 <h1>Meeting Notes</h1> 
  <p>It has been stated many times taking brief notes will help us pay attentions and 
    remember vital spiritual truths. On top of that, having notes saved, will allow us
    to review a talk that touched us, or help us find an illustration that we heard before 
    at a meeting, but can't remember its details.</p>
  
  <p> The goal of this application is to help us make better notes at theocratic meetings. 
    As we make more and more notes, allow us to search through these notes to find certain 
    verse explanations or illustrations that we have heard in past meetings.

   <!-- Using a note taking app and then switching to another app to look up a verse, 
    could be a bit tedious, so having these two functions in a single place, 
    will greatly improve our note taking experience. This -->
